        A method to make the computer's move, or sugget a move to a user.
        It returns True if this move resulted in a win, False otherwise.

        Note, this method was written to work generically for any "player,"
        as specified by that player's X/O character.  However, it does actually
        change the board, so it can't just suggest a move.

        Win or draw with the following strategry (courtesy of Wikipedia):

        1. Win: If the player has two in a row, play the third to get three in
           a row.
        2. Block: If the opponent has two in a row,play the third to block them
        3. Fork: Create an opportunity where you can win in two ways.
        4. Block opponent's fork:
          * Option 1: Create two in a row to force the opponent into
           defending, as long as it doesn't result in them creating a fork or
           winning. For example, if "X" has a corner, "O" has the center, and
           "X" has the opposite corner as well, "O" must not play a corner in
           order to win. (Playing a corner in this scenario creates a fork for
           "X" to win.)
          * Option 2: If there is a configuration where the opponent can fork,
           block that fork.
        5. Center: Play the center.
        6. Opposite corner: If the opponent is in the corner, play the opposite
           corner.
        7. Empty corner: Play in a corner square.
        8. Empty side: Play in a middle square on any of the 4 sides.
